## User Stories

Social connectivity rather than social "media".

People's profiles would be representations of their actual personas. Wouldn't need extra information outside of their personal profile.

User prompted to search for connections when they log in.

Once a user has connections, they can start a chat with a connection (this creates a "group" but is advertised as a chat).
